# Dynasite
Java Gradle project template for easy development of backend webservers, with provided utilities for simple backend functions.
Developed for my own personal use, however provided here for anyone who can find use from it, with no restrictions. Code is
released freely into the public domain: have fun!

## Useage
Clone the code, and begin modifying the template files. Project is runnable, and will host a simple template website when run.
There are test cases which demonstrate some of the most common usages and functionality, which is a good place to start looking
for examples and how to use the project. Most classes are (fairly well) documented, which should help.
